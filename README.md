I created this repo as a starting point for NodeJS projects going forward. Mainly because I don't want to install npm locally and want to containerise everything.

## Install

```
# make install
```

## Create a Project

```
# make create-project
```

## Run a local server

> This will only work after you have created a project with the abover command

```
# make dev
```
